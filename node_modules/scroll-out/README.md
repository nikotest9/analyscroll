## Why should I use this?
- Animate or reveal elements as they scroll into view using CSS or JavaScript
- Super tiny JavaScript library at 1KB minified and gzipped.
- Free for commercial and non-commercial use under the MIT license.

## How do I use it?

Install ScrollOut and decorate elements with the ```data-scroll``` attribute.  As elements become visible, ```data-scroll``` will be set to ```in``` and when elements are scrolled out they will be set with ```out```.  Add your own CSS or JS to make a big impression when things come into view.  That's it!
